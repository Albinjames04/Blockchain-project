# Decentralized Esports Tournament Smart Contract

## Description
This Move-based Aptos smart contract enables the creation of decentralized esports tournaments with transparent on-chain prize distribution and an anti-cheat validation mechanism. The contract ensures that tournament winnings are only distributed if anti-cheat verification passes, thereby promoting fairness and trust among participants.

## Vision
To build a transparent, trustless, and community-driven esports ecosystem where tournament hosting, participation, and reward distribution are all governed by on-chain logic â€” eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries and reducing cheating risks.

## Future Scope
- **On-chain Player Registration**: Allow participants to register and pay entry fees directly into the prize pool.
- **Automated Prize Pool Management**: Lock funds from multiple players and release them based on match results and anti-cheat checks.
- **Decentralized Anti-Cheat Oracles**: Integrate with decentralized oracle networks for external cheat detection.
- **Multi-Winner Support**: Enable prize splitting for team-based games or multiple ranked positions.
- **Leaderboard Integration**: Store and update player rankings on-chain.
